Neal currently works as a criminal consultant for the White Collar Crime Division of the FBI in New York City. He is a world-class forger and conman, with a fondness for art, fine wine, Sy Devore suits, fedoras, and beautiful women. Neal speaks eight languages, including conversational Swahili, and has 27 known aliases.<br /><br />Caffrey was suspected of hundreds of thefts before Agent Peter Burke of the FBI apprehended him. Neal received a four-year sentence for bond forgery. After escaping from prison—and getting caught once again by Agent Burke—Neal struck a bargain: in exchange for his release from prison, Neal helps the FBI catch the most cunning white collar criminals in the country. Now, Neal must walk the line between his new job as a top FBI consultant, and his old life as a white collar criminal.<br /><br />Matt Bomer portrays Neal Caffrey on White Collar. Bomer describes the character as having &quot;the veneer of the charming, hyper-intelligent, eloquent, sly mastermind, but underneath, he was really a kind of diehard romantic who would go to any lengths to find the love of his life&quot;.","jobs":[{"href":"/subject/105389","name":"White Collar Season 6","nameCn":"妙警贼探 第六季","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/02/be/105389_7cepf.jpg","staff":"主角","cast":"Matt Bomer","castHref":"/person/17668","castTag":"CV","castCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/ce/a0/17668_prsn_lyiqF.jpg"},{"href":"/subject/84343","name":"White Collar Season 5","nameCn":"妙警贼探 第五季","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/b1/bb/84343_q058O.jpg","staff":"主角","cast":"Matt Bomer","castHref":"/person/17668","castTag":"CV","castCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/ce/a0/17668_prsn_lyiqF.jpg"},{"href":"/subject/43394","name":"White Collar Season 4","nameCn":"妙警贼探 第四季","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/e6/af/43394_lwcLL.jpg","staff":"主角","cast":"Matt Bomer","castHref":"/person/17668","castTag":"CV","castCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/ce/a0/17668_prsn_lyiqF.jpg"},{"href":"/subject/18665","name":"White Collar Season 3","nameCn":"妙警贼探 第三季","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/b1/0a/18665_QWRAR.jpg","staff":"主角","cast":"Matt Bomer","castHref":"/person/17668","castTag":"CV","castCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/ce/a0/17668_prsn_lyiqF.jpg"},{"href":"/subject/7295","name":"White Collar Season 2","nameCn":"妙警贼探 第二季","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/f9/53/7295_ucjZ1.jpg","staff":"主角","cast":"Matt Bomer","castHref":"/person/17668","castTag":"CV","castCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/ce/a0/17668_prsn_lyiqF.jpg"},{"href":"/subject/3897","name":"White Collar Season 1","nameCn":"妙警贼探 第一季","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/b9/57/3897_7Yx43.jpg","staff":"主角","cast":"Matt Bomer","castHref":"/person/17668","castTag":"CV","castCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/ce/a0/17668_prsn_lyiqF.jpg"}]}
