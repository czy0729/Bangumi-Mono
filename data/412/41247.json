During the events of October 2016, Paul was working on Project Promenade, a time travel experiment based upon the work of William Joyce, Jack's brother. Against the warning of William, Paul convinced an uninformed Jack to help him test the time machine's functionality. When a malfunction in the machine's core caused the breakdown in time, Paul was forced to go through the machine and witnessed the End of Time in the year 2021. In attempt to survive, but not prevent, the breakdown of time caused by the fracture, Paul traveled back to the year 1999 and founded Monarch Solutions, a corporation designed to aid him in the survival of the human race while a solution was found.","jobs":[{"href":"/subject/94278","name":"Quantum Break","nameCn":"量子破碎","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/cc/33/94278_9g59m.jpg","staff":"主角","cast":"","castHref":"","castTag":"","castCover":"","type":4}]}
