During the events of October 2016, Wincott maintained an aspect of Monarch's computer security and worked with Monarch Security to track Jack Joyce following the incident at the Riverport University. He was used by Fiona Miller, who worked with Beth Wilder, in order to gain access to Gull Island's Research Facility in the hopes of obtaining the CFR.
