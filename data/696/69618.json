She is considered greedy, money-hungry, and always out for herself, but eventually her more noble goals and traits are made known to the party. Working as a Lens Hunter with her partner, Mary Argent, Rutee kills monsters to acquire Lens and sell it to Oberon Corporation for Gald. When not fighting against monsters for her money, Rutee can be found combing ancient ruins for treasures to sell. Rutee is the mistress of Atwight, the Swordian of Water, who also excels at healing magic. Atwight has been with her as long as she can remember and is like a mother figure for the girl. Rutee is also the mother of the sequel's protagonist, Kyle Dunamis.","jobs":[{"href":"/subject/1555","name":"テイルズ オブ デスティニー","nameCn":"宿命传说","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/b2/dd/1555_bv5yZ.jpg","staff":"主角","cast":"今井由香","castHref":"/person/3833","castTag":"CV","castCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/0e/32/3833_prsn_udUHN.jpg"},{"href":"/subject/1551","name":"テイルズ オブ デスティニー2","nameCn":"宿命传说2","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/4e/6c/1551_1PCNt.jpg","staff":"配角","cast":"今井由香","castHref":"/person/3833","castTag":"CV","castCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/0e/32/3833_prsn_udUHN.jpg"},{"href":"/subject/72194","name":"NAMCO x CAPCOM","nameCn":"南梦宫X卡普空","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/c3/f2/72194_VnXN1.jpg","staff":"配角","cast":"今井由香","castHref":"/person/3833","castTag":"CV","castCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/0e/32/3833_prsn_udUHN.jpg"},{"href":"/subject/161051","name":"テイルズ オブ ザ レイズ","nameCn":"镜光传说","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/fa/78/161051_x4499.jpg","staff":"配角","cast":"今井由香","castHref":"/person/3833","castTag":"CV","castCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/0e/32/3833_prsn_udUHN.jpg"}]}
