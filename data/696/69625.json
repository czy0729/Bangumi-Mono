He is an estranged 26-year-old son of an aristocratic family, choosing the lifestyle of a bard over the riches of his family's estate. He may seem fragile from outward appearances, but he can provide useful support in the battle party through songs played on his lute. When his lute songs are learned, Karyl can become surprisingly strong, but he has no Swordian.","jobs":[{"href":"/subject/1555","name":"Tales of Destiny","nameCn":"宿命传说","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/b2/dd/1555_JbarK.jpg","staff":"配角","cast":"山寺宏一","castHref":"/person/3914","castTag":"CV","castCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/36/d6/3914_prsn_pX74x.jpg"}]}
