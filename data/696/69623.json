In the original PlayStation version of the game, Mary joins the party as a required member during early parts of the game, but after a specific point in the story, Mary's services as a party member are either removed or become fully optional, based on a divergent plot element in the game that depends on the player's actions. In the PlayStation 2 remake of the game, however, Mary remains with the party as a permanent member.","jobs":[{"href":"/subject/161051","name":"テイルズ オブ ザ レイズ","nameCn":"镜光传说","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/fa/78/161051_x4499.jpg","staff":"配角","cast":"天野由梨","castHref":"/person/4124","castTag":"CV","castCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/7d/c3/4124_seiyu_anidb.jpg"},{"href":"/subject/1555","name":"テイルズ オブ デスティニー","nameCn":"宿命传说","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/b2/dd/1555_bv5yZ.jpg","staff":"配角","cast":"天野由梨","castHref":"/person/4124","castTag":"CV","castCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/7d/c3/4124_seiyu_anidb.jpg"}]}
