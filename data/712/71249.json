Originally a Dathomiri Nightbrother born on Iridonia and known only as Maul, the infant Maul was given by his Nightsister mother to the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, who trained him in the ways of the dark side of the Force as his secret apprentice on a secret Mustafar training facility, along with the help of a split personality droid. Maul became a master of lightsaber combat and Teräs Käsi, wielding a red-bladed saberstaff against any adversary. Though well trained in the ways of the Sith and a Sith assassin rather than a full apprentice, Maul was technically a violation of the Rule of Two because his own Master was at the time apprenticed to another, the Muun Sith Lord Darth Plagueis. Plagueis, however, was fully aware of Maul's existence, and supported Sidious's decision to train him. The primary reason for Plagueis's support, despite the violation of the Rule of Two, was that Maul was trained to be expendable. As an assassin, he could perform high priority, boots-on-the-ground missions for the Sith without running the risk of exposing either Plagueis or Sidious should he fail.","jobs":[{"href":"/subject/212924","name":"Star Wars Rebels (Season 3)","nameCn":"星球大战：义军崛起 第三季","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/a3/75/212924_GSeGB.jpg","staff":"配角","cast":"Samuel Witwer","castHref":"/person/28678","castTag":"CV","castCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/18/16/28678_prsn_UyYb3.jpg"},{"href":"/subject/212923","name":"Star Wars Rebels (Season 2)","nameCn":"星球大战：义军崛起 第二季","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/20/51/212923_vtiR9.jpg","staff":"配角","cast":"Samuel Witwer","castHref":"/person/28678","castTag":"CV","castCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/18/16/28678_prsn_UyYb3.jpg"},{"href":"/subject/60389","name":"Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace","nameCn":"星球大战前传1：幽灵的威胁","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/fb/48/60389_C984K.jpg","staff":"配角","cast":"Ray Park","castHref":"/person/35259","castTag":"CV","castCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/56/63/35259_prsn_9rzpw.jpg"},{"href":"/subject/137316","name":"Star Wars The Clone Wars Season 4","nameCn":"星球大战：克隆战争 第四季","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/41/ab/45095_c297S.jpg","staff":"配角","cast":"Samuel Witwer","castHref":"/person/28678","castTag":"CV","castCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/18/16/28678_prsn_UyYb3.jpg"},{"href":"/subject/137315","name":"Star Wars The Clone Wars Season 3","nameCn":"星球大战：克隆战争 第三季","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/b6/89/20064_IarRR.jpg","staff":"配角","cast":"Samuel Witwer","castHref":"/person/28678","castTag":"CV","castCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/18/16/28678_prsn_UyYb3.jpg"},{"href":"/subject/137317","name":"Star Wars The Clone Wars Season 5","nameCn":"星球大战：克隆战争 第五季","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/7a/d8/81106_QDBMC.jpg","staff":"配角","cast":"Samuel Witwer","castHref":"/person/28678","castTag":"CV","castCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/18/16/28678_prsn_UyYb3.jpg"},{"href":"/subject/295039","name":"Star Wars The Clone Wars Season 7","nameCn":"星球大战：克隆人战争 第七季","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/78/86/295039_NgNNx.jpg","staff":"配角","cast":"","castHref":"","castTag":"","castCover":""},{"href":"/subject/247805","name":"Solo: A Star Wars Story","nameCn":"游侠索罗：星球大战外传","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/eb/ce/247805_kSD17.jpg","staff":"客串","cast":"Ray Park","castHref":"/person/35259","castTag":"CV","castCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/56/63/35259_prsn_9rzpw.jpg"}]}
