Tauburn's color scheme is mainly red, white and gold but with blue for the orb in Tauburn's chest from which Takuto pilots his respective Cybody . Tauburn also has a set of Piles on it's lower back which could possibly resemble the loose tail of a jacket. In episode 16, Tauburn's appearance undergoes some minor changes; the orb in the middle takes a red colour, the spherical Cybody joints became white, the solid red colour on Tauburn's chest becomes white with red stripes, the masquerade mask gains a long spike under each eye, the hat becomes a bit wider, the shoulder armor gains a more V-like shape, Tauburn's shoes also have spikes and the two outer Piles are elongated.","jobs":[{"href":"/subject/7348","name":"STAR DRIVER 輝きのタクト","nameCn":"STAR DRIVER 闪亮的拓人","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/d8/63/7348_2Ciub.jpg","staff":"配角","cast":"","castHref":"","castTag":"","castCover":"","type":2}]}
