She is voiced and motion-captured by Shannon Woodward. <br /><br />A few days after the end of Dina and Jesse's relationship, there was a celebration in a church within the settlement. Dina danced with a man from the group, much to the jealousy of her ex-boyfriend. She invited Ellie, who was drinking at the bar, to dance with her.
