He lives in Jackson County along with Ellie and Dina.<br /><br />At an unknown celebration in the settlement, Jesse grew jealous when he saw his now ex-girlfriend Dina dance with another boy from the group. He approached Ellie at the bar, telling her how her &quot;old man&quot; had berated him earlier that day for slacking while leading his group on patrol and how he grows more involved whenever Ellie is scheduled to patrol with them. Ellie dismissed him, soon being pulled to the dance floor by Dina, leaving Jesse to watch the pair dance.","jobs":[{"href":"/subject/200187","name":"The Last of Us: Part II","nameCn":"最后生还者2","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/8f/59/200187_t8u5U.jpg","staff":"配角","cast":"杉田智和","castHref":"/person/4513","castTag":"CV","castCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/72/98/4513_prsn_6HNa0.jpg"}]}
