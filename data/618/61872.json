A Cheerful Child with a Dark and Troubled Past, armed with tricks and traps.<br /><br />Her color is yellow to demonstrate her happy-go-lucky nature. Yuki is good at distraction: her Little Trap and Bird Whistle combination is invaluably useful, and while her slow body-carrying speed may seem a detriment, it allows her to carry bodies into green-striped guard vision cones. Yuki suffers from the problems of both Mugen and Hayato in less severity—while she can easily distract guards and assassinate them one by one, she has no innate ranged options (though she gets a matchlock pistol like the others do in the mid-game) and must pick her Little Trap back up in order to reuse it. She is also the only character capable of pickpocketing items from living enemies.","jobs":[{"href":"/subject/205044","name":"Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun","nameCn":"影子战术：将军之刃","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/94/c5/205044_YwzK1.jpg","staff":"主角","cast":"舞原ゆめ","castHref":"/person/22285","castTag":"CV","castCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/09/5a/22285_prsn_g6ywk.jpg"}]}
