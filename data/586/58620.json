His fighting style is Bajiquan,[3] a Chinese martial art (pronounced &quot;Hakkyoku-Ken&quot; in Japanese). Canonically, he won the second World Fighting Tournament (Virtua Fighter 2).[4] Akira strives for perfection and will drive himself relentlessly to master his techniques. He seeks worthy opponents to fight in order to find flaws in his skills to further attain mastery. In the original Virtua Fighter, Akira serves as the assistant instructor at Yuki Budokan and is known to be hot-blooded and impulsive by nature. He also can be naive and intemperate. After completing his training under his grandfather's tutelage at the age of 23, he went on a quest to test his abilities. When he got word of the 1st World Fighting Tournament, he decided to enter and test his abilities. Although he won the second tournament, he still unable to achieve his grandfather's wish to see what &quot;true strength&quot; means, thus begin to seek it in the next tournaments on his grandfather's behalf. He was a childhood friend of Aoi Umenokoji.<br /><br />In the Virtua Fighter anime, Akira starts his quest to see the eight stars in heaven after he had gotten overconfident in his Bajiquan skills from his days training with his grandfather. He is often seen as a comedic glutton in the anime series, as opposed to the games where he is serious and disciplined. Akira Yuki and Jacky Bryant are partners in Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing. He appears in Project X Zone with Pai Chan as his partner, and returns in the sequel with Kage-Maru as his partner. He also appears as a guest character in Dead or Alive 5. He appears in Dengeki Bunko:&nbsp;&nbsp;Fighting Climax as a boss, as well as a playable fighter, with Pai as his assist, and was originally a non-playable final boss character in previous console release of arcade version, then eventually becoming a regular character in Ignition update. Akira subsequently appear in the Super Smash Bros. series, first appearing as a Mii Fighter costume, based on his original polygonal Virtua Fighter appearance, in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U as downloadable content (alongside a Jacky Mii Fighter costume based on the fifth game), then he appears as an Assist Trophy in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.","jobs":[{"href":"/subject/657","name":"バーチャファイター5","nameCn":"VR战士5","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/b4/28/657_C4CTC.jpg","staff":"主角","cast":"三木眞一郎","castHref":"/person/4101","castTag":"CV","castCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/05/0c/4101_prsn_nDWPw.jpg","type":4},{"href":"/subject/300276","name":"バーチャファイター3","nameCn":"VR战士3","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/40/49/300276_UoNFO.jpg","staff":"主角","cast":"","castHref":"","castTag":"","castCover":"","type":4},{"href":"/subject/300281","name":"バーチャファイターキッズ","nameCn":"VR战士 孩童","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/2d/7f/300281_9nElt.jpg","staff":"主角","cast":"","castHref":"","castTag":"","castCover":"","type":4},{"href":"/subject/300277","name":"バーチャファイター4","nameCn":"VR战士4","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/b8/04/300277_00p1F.jpg","staff":"主角","cast":"","castHref":"","castTag":"","castCover":"","type":4},{"href":"/subject/298444","name":"バーチャファイター","nameCn":"VR战士","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/1b/c3/298444_688Mz.jpg","staff":"主角","cast":"","castHref":"","castTag":"","castCover":"","type":4},{"href":"/subject/57021","name":"バーチャファイター2","nameCn":"VR战士2","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/bd/e9/57021_s4In8.jpg","staff":"主角","cast":"三木眞一郎","castHref":"/person/4101","castTag":"CV","castCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/05/0c/4101_prsn_nDWPw.jpg","type":4},{"href":"/subject/104017","name":"バーチャファイター","nameCn":"VR快打","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/ad/b6/104017_MvOmk.jpg","staff":"主角","cast":"三木眞一郎","castHref":"/person/4101","castTag":"CV","castCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/05/0c/4101_prsn_nDWPw.jpg","type":2},{"href":"/subject/249470","name":"大乱闘スマッシュブラザーズ SPECIAL","nameCn":"任天堂明星大乱斗 特别版","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/26/99/249470_3s3i3.jpg","staff":"配角","cast":"三木眞一郎","castHref":"/person/4101","castTag":"CV","castCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/05/0c/4101_prsn_nDWPw.jpg","type":4},{"href":"/subject/133715","name":"プロジェクト クロスゾーン2：ブレイブニューワールド","nameCn":"交叉领域计划2：美丽新世界","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/c1/0e/133715_u9M7C.jpg","staff":"配角","cast":"三木眞一郎","castHref":"/person/4101","castTag":"CV","castCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/05/0c/4101_prsn_nDWPw.jpg","type":4},{"href":"/subject/37544","name":"Dead or Alive 5","nameCn":"死或生5","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/d1/b1/37544_8z868.jpg","staff":"配角","cast":"三木眞一郎","castHref":"/person/4101","castTag":"CV","castCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/05/0c/4101_prsn_nDWPw.jpg","type":4},{"href":"/subject/106077","name":"大乱闘スマッシュブラザーズ for ニンテンドー3DS","nameCn":"任天堂明星大乱斗 for Nintendo 3DS","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/0f/25/106077_pwH7u.jpg","staff":"客串","cast":"三木眞一郎","castHref":"/person/4101","castTag":"CV","castCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/05/0c/4101_prsn_nDWPw.jpg","type":4},{"href":"/subject/75645","name":"大乱闘スマッシュブラザーズ for Wii U","nameCn":"任天堂明星大乱斗 for Wii U","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/a7/4c/75645_0uCP6.jpg","staff":"客串","cast":"三木眞一郎","castHref":"/person/4101","castTag":"CV","castCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/05/0c/4101_prsn_nDWPw.jpg","type":4},{"href":"/subject/146296","name":"電撃文庫 FIGHTING CLIMAX IGNITION","nameCn":"电击文库 巅峰格斗者再燃","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/3e/87/146296_v2mqq.jpg","staff":"客串","cast":"三木眞一郎","castHref":"/person/4101","castTag":"CV","castCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/05/0c/4101_prsn_nDWPw.jpg","type":4},{"href":"/subject/84944","name":"電撃文庫 FIGHTING CLIMAX","nameCn":"电击文库 格斗巅峰","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/cf/6f/84944_MFRrh.jpg","staff":"客串","cast":"三木眞一郎","castHref":"/person/4101","castTag":"CV","castCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/05/0c/4101_prsn_nDWPw.jpg","type":4}]}
