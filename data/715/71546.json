She has affiliations with Bridges.<br /><br /><br />Story<br />Somehow, Mama's daughter was born on the &quot;other side&quot; and manifested as a beached thing. Mama and her daughter are still connected to one another via an ethereal umbilical cord. For an unknown reason, Mama's child is fixed to a Bridges compound, resulting in Mama likewise being unable to leave the compound.<br /><br />At some point, Mama finds herself almost entirely trapped underneath fallen concrete debris, save for her head.<br /><br /><br />Notes<br />Mama's outfit bears a Bridges insignia different from the standard one. It is uniquely monochrome, uses a different font for &quot;Bridges&quot;, and features a completely different webbed design – one not based on the continental United Cities. (The unique insignia can be seen in the full resolution infobox image of her above.)<br />Mama lactates, despite her beached daughter being unable to drink the produced milk.","jobs":[{"href":"/subject/185181","name":"DEATH STRANDING","nameCn":"死亡搁浅","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/3f/98/185181_uB35U.jpg","staff":"配角","cast":"坂本真綾","castHref":"/person/3877","castTag":"CV","castCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/d4/88/3877_prsn_VOY27.jpg"}]}
