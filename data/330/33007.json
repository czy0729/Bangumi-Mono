Before the dead started to rise, it was assumed that he was a family man and went out and provided for his wife and son. But the apocalypse took its toll and after his wife was turned into a zombie he was able to cope due to him still having his son, Duane, to look after. Morgan is like Rick Grimes in some ways as they are both survivors doing all they can to provide for their family and to keep them safe. However, unlike Rick, Morgan views every life as precious and even refused to kill two members of the Wolves who had attempted to kill him as he was camped out in the woods. After Rick left to find his family in Atlanta, Morgan began to get reckless, which eventually led to the death of his son. The next time Rick encountered Morgan, he was a changed man, who had become insane and intensively grief-stricken with the death of his family, so he claimed to redeem himself by killing all of the zombies in King County. Since then, however, he has found his sanity again and has regained part of his former self, once seeking out sanctuary at Terminus before a sign for the community redesigned to warn that Terminus is &quot;no sanctuary&quot; turned him away. Afterwards, he found a map to Washington, D.C, with Rick's name on it and he set out on a quest to find his old friend, which he eventually did after being brought to the Alexandria Safe-Zone with recruiters Daryl and Aaron, only to find Rick executing Pete Anderson.","jobs":[{"href":"/subject/126801","name":"The Walking Dead Season 6","nameCn":"行尸走肉 第六季","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/1a/b1/126801_puNI9.jpg","staff":"主角","cast":"","castHref":"","castTag":"","castCover":"","type":6},{"href":"/subject/153804","name":"The Walking Dead Season 7","nameCn":"行尸走肉 第七季","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/9c/cc/153804_Y4c64.jpg","staff":"主角","cast":"","castHref":"","castTag":"","castCover":"","type":6},{"href":"/subject/212464","name":"The Walking Dead Season 8","nameCn":"行尸走肉 第八季","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/15/6f/212464_sooo4.jpg","staff":"主角","cast":"","castHref":"","castTag":"","castCover":"","type":6},{"href":"/subject/244217","name":"Fear the Walking Dead Season 4","nameCn":"行尸之惧 第四季","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/47/7c/244217_4zY7M.jpg","staff":"主角","cast":"","castHref":"","castTag":"","castCover":"","type":6},{"href":"/subject/9644","name":"The Walking Dead Season 1","nameCn":"行尸走肉 第一季","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/cf/a3/9644_Xk544.jpg","staff":"配角","cast":"","castHref":"","castTag":"","castCover":"","type":6},{"href":"/subject/114538","name":"The Walking Dead Season 5","nameCn":"行尸走肉 第五季","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/b3/22/114538_ijzvV.jpg","staff":"客串","cast":"","castHref":"","castTag":"","castCover":"","type":6},{"href":"/subject/49819","name":"The Walking Dead Season 3","nameCn":"行尸走肉 第三季","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/c3/fd/49819_LN88F.jpg","staff":"客串","cast":"","castHref":"","castTag":"","castCover":"","type":6}]}
