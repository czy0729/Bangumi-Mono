A Friendly Sniper who uses long-range weaponry to take out his foes.<br /><br />His colour is green, representing his Nice Guy nature and Cool Old Guy status. Takuma is good at assassination: Takuma's rifle is invaluable to killing targets from long range and his grenades can take out groups of enemies from a distance. He is also the only one who can use the rifle, making him very useful for dealing with faraway targets. However, Takuma has the most handicaps in more ways than just having a pegleg—his run makes noise, he's very slow, he's immobile while shooting, he can't pick up bodies, swim or climb vines, his ammo and grenades come in short supply and he has no means of melee attacking; meaning if a guard bumps into him he has to risk a shot with the matchlock pistol or run.","jobs":[{"href":"/subject/205044","name":"Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun","nameCn":"影子战术：将军之刃","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/94/c5/205044_YwzK1.jpg","staff":"主角","cast":"","castHref":"","castTag":"","castCover":""}]}
