A Blood Knight with a Hidden Heart of Gold and the skills to back up his rank.<br /><br />His color is reddish-orange, reflecting his nature as a Blood Knight and is the same colors as the Shogun's forces. Mugen is good at crowd control: he is excellent at taking out numerous guards at once, and his sake can take apart some tricky patrols. His large health pool and ability to lift two bodies at once are useful, but Mugen has no innate long-range abilities (though he gets a hand cannon in the mid-game), leaving him at the mercy of getting guards to come to him.","jobs":[{"href":"/subject/205044","name":"Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun","nameCn":"影子战术：将军之刃","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/94/c5/205044_YwzK1.jpg","staff":"主角","cast":"","castHref":"","castTag":"","castCover":""}]}
