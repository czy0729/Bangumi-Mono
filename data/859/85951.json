Hayato is a no-nonsense professional mercenary who's initially only in the story for the paycheck.<br /><br />His color is blue, reflecting his nature as The Stoic. Hayato is good at infiltrating: he's excellent at getting in and out of areas and creating distractions to allow himself to slip by. His Shuriken is also a useful alternative to matchlock pistols (available from the mid-game), as it has more range and only produces noise around the target. He lacks any kind of major distraction however—he can't draw a guard's attention for long, and he's only good for taking out one guard at a time.","jobs":[{"href":"/subject/205044","name":"Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun","nameCn":"影子战术：将军之刃","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/94/c5/205044_YwzK1.jpg","staff":"主角","cast":"","castHref":"","castTag":"","castCover":"","type":4}]}
