He is a private investigator and, prior to his reluctant arrival in Columbia, a former Pinkerton agent. Booker is offered a deal to wipe away his gambling debts if he goes to Columbia and retrieves a girl imprisoned there. Over the course of the story, Booker reveals his past experiences, and shows his ability to make decisions independent of the player. Unlike Jack and Subject Delta, Booker has his own persona rather than being a blank and faceless avatar for the player.","jobs":[{"href":"/subject/8703","name":"Bioshock Infinite","nameCn":"生化奇兵：无限","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/21/2a/8703_2B60M.jpg","staff":"主角","cast":"藤原啓治","castHref":"/person/4016","castTag":"CV","castCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/ae/9c/4016_prsn_KYg1E.jpg"}]}
