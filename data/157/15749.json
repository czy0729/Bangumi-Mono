A 17-year-old girl from the Southern Water Tribe, she is as hot-headed and eager as she is talented. When she runs away to Republic City, her stubbornness and impatience get in the way of her bending studies, but it is clear from the start that she is destined for greatness. Korra discovers many new things in Republic City - some amazing and some terrifying. Whether its honing her bending skills in the Pro-bending Arena, facing off with street thugs or facing an anti-bending rebellion, Korra learns that being the Avatar comes with many dangers and responsibilities. As if being a teenager wasn't hard enough on its own!","jobs":[{"href":"/subject/88411","name":"The Legend of Korra Book 3: Change","nameCn":"科拉传奇 第三季：易","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/56/89/88411_ZNs2x.jpg","staff":"主角","cast":"","castHref":"","castTag":"","castCover":"","type":2},{"href":"/subject/10599","name":"The Legend of Korra Book 1: Air","nameCn":"科拉传奇 第一季：气和","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/ed/16/10599_OOS7z.jpg","staff":"主角","cast":"","castHref":"","castTag":"","castCover":"","type":2},{"href":"/subject/43180","name":"The Legend of Korra Book 2: Spirits","nameCn":"科拉传奇 第二季：神灵","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/fa/ba/43180_j9TjZ.jpg","staff":"主角","cast":"","castHref":"","castTag":"","castCover":"","type":2},{"href":"/subject/114184","name":"The Legend of Korra Book 4: Balance","nameCn":"科拉传奇 第四季：平衡","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/53/9c/114184_b5U7U.jpg","staff":"主角","cast":"","castHref":"","castTag":"","castCover":"","type":2}]}
