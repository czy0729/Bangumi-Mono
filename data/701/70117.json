Originally, he was the chief of the wizards and of the White Council that opposed Sauron. His extensive studies of dark magic, however, eventually led him to desire the One Ring for himself. Thinking he could ally himself with Sauron and then betray him, Saruman allied Isengard with Mordor in the War of the Ring, in which he was defeated.<br /><br />He studied deeply the arts of Sauron, the better to oppose him, but he soon became enamored of Sauron's devices, especially the One Ring. He betrayed his mission and sought the power of the Ring for himself. He initially advocated an alliance with Sauron, but he soon betrayed Sauron as well, as his ultimate goal was to supplant Sauron and rule Middle-earth. But his plans came to nought, and his power was broken in the Battle of the Hornburg and the Battle of Isengard.<br /><br />Before his fall, he was the chief of both the wizards and of the White Council (a league of all those opposed to Sauron). His knowledge and skill, especially of Sauron's devices, was said to be great. However, his deep study of the One Ring and Sauron's other magic corrupted him, and his overweening lust for power led to his downfall. He is one of the few characters in Middle-earth who is morally &quot;grey&quot; - serving neither good nor evil. He betrays both sides and ultimately works for his own ends.","jobs":[{"href":"/subject/83551","name":"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey","nameCn":"霍比特人1：意外之旅","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/9c/93/83551_fy45d.jpg","staff":"配角","cast":"Christopher Lee","castHref":"/person/34666","castTag":"CV","castCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/42/6d/34666_prsn_YT1cc.jpg","type":6},{"href":"/subject/97919","name":"The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug","nameCn":"霍比特人2：史矛革之战","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/3c/44/97919_7Yuq2.jpg","staff":"配角","cast":"Christopher Lee","castHref":"/person/34666","castTag":"CV","castCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/42/6d/34666_prsn_YT1cc.jpg","type":6},{"href":"/subject/109452","name":"The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies","nameCn":"霍比特人3：五军之战","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/aa/2d/109452_Mgzm6.jpg","staff":"配角","cast":"Christopher Lee","castHref":"/person/34666","castTag":"CV","castCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/42/6d/34666_prsn_YT1cc.jpg","type":6},{"href":"/subject/25462","name":"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers","nameCn":"魔戒2：双塔奇兵","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/30/29/25462_8OkAb.jpg","staff":"配角","cast":"Christopher Lee","castHref":"/person/34666","castTag":"CV","castCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/42/6d/34666_prsn_YT1cc.jpg","type":6},{"href":"/subject/25464","name":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring","nameCn":"魔戒：护戒使者","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/f9/50/25464_2gdwd.jpg","staff":"配角","cast":"Christopher Lee","castHref":"/person/34666","castTag":"CV","castCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/42/6d/34666_prsn_YT1cc.jpg","type":6},{"href":"/subject/25465","name":"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King","nameCn":"魔戒3：王者归来","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/f7/5d/25465_ANexQ.jpg","staff":"配角","cast":"Christopher Lee","castHref":"/person/34666","castTag":"CV","castCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/42/6d/34666_prsn_YT1cc.jpg","type":6},{"href":"/subject/113242","name":"The Lord of the Rings","nameCn":"魔戒","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/c1/c1/113242_OyC9L.jpg","staff":"配角","cast":"","castHref":"","castTag":"","castCover":"","type":1},{"href":"/subject/743","name":"Lord of the Rings: Return of the King","nameCn":"指环王：王者归来","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/5c/57/743_vR297.jpg","staff":"配角","cast":"Christopher Lee","castHref":"/person/34666","castTag":"CV","castCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/42/6d/34666_prsn_YT1cc.jpg","type":4},{"href":"/subject/235405","name":"The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth","nameCn":"魔戒：中土战争","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/0a/06/235405_YzzOH.jpg","staff":"配角","cast":"Christopher Lee","castHref":"/person/34666","castTag":"CV","castCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/42/6d/34666_prsn_YT1cc.jpg","type":4},{"href":"/subject/30075","name":"The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-Earth II","nameCn":"指环王：中土战争2","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/cd/0e/30075_3b3t9.jpg","staff":"配角","cast":"Christopher Lee","castHref":"/person/34666","castTag":"CV","castCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/42/6d/34666_prsn_YT1cc.jpg","type":4},{"href":"/subject/741","name":"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers","nameCn":"指环王：双塔奇兵","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/2e/65/741_aus.jpg","staff":"配角","cast":"Jim Ward","castHref":"/person/34241","castTag":"CV","castCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/fe/06/34241_prsn_oY9y7.jpg","type":4}]}
