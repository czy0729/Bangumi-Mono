She is only seen in some of the later unlocked storylines. She is shown as a very timid girl that has had no real connection to anyone since her arrival at camp. She often relies on the food she pilfers from the cantina and the different nuts and berries found in the forest surrounding the camp. Though it is unclear how she arrived at the camp, she is knowledgeable of the situation of the protagonist.","jobs":[{"href":"/subject/105755","name":"Бесконечное лето","nameCn":"永恒之夏","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/6b/fc/105755_l0gyR.jpg","staff":"主角","cast":"","castHref":"","castTag":"","castCover":""}]}
