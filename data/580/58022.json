She is shown as a very outgoing and aggressive girl that doesn't take no for an answer, but her soft side is revealed later in the game. Her friendship with Lena has led to a complicated situation, but she still maintains a relatively good relationship with her. She is often angered because of people labeling her as a punk girl with no sense of order, but even though some of it might be true, she only does it to escape the boredom and odd looks from being at the camp.","jobs":[{"href":"/subject/105755","name":"Бесконечное лето","nameCn":"永恒之夏","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/6b/fc/105755_l0gyR.jpg","staff":"主角","cast":"","castHref":"","castTag":"","castCover":""}]}
