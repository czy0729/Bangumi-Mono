He is the son of a wealthy family and the heir of the C&amp;R International company. He is always on business trips and only talks about work or mature topics, which is why he doesn't know about youth slang or commoner food. Jumin loves to talk about his cat, Elizabeth 3rd, and how beautiful she is and is very much a doting parent. However, because of past experiences, Jumin is emotionally closed off and is distrustful of women, having witnessed his father fall victim to many gold-diggers who never loved his father, only his money.","jobs":[{"href":"/subject/198696","name":"수상한 메신저","nameCn":"神秘的信使","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/b1/7a/198696_55Uj1.jpg","staff":"主角","cast":"신용우","castHref":"/person/32953","castTag":"CV","castCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/10/86/32953_prsn_ZSOQO.jpg","type":4}]}
