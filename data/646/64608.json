Although he was not the founder of the Komnenian dynasty, it was during his reign that the Komnenos family came to full power. Inheriting a collapsing empire and faced with constant warfare during his reign against both the Seljuq Turks in Asia Minor and the Normans in the western Balkans, Alexios was able to curb the Byzantine decline and begin the military, financial, and territorial recovery known as the Komnenian restoration. The basis for this recovery were various reforms initiated by Alexios. His appeals to Western Europe for help against the Turks were also the catalyst that likely contributed to the convoking of the Crusades.","jobs":[{"href":"/subject/33895","name":"Crusader Kings II","nameCn":"十字军之王2","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/9b/f1/33895_gj7Gt.jpg","staff":"主角","cast":"","castHref":"","castTag":"","castCover":""}]}
