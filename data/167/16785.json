He was the son of the royal Peacock family and the heir to the Gongmen City throne.<br /><br />In his youth, Shen was obsessed with using the powder in fireworks to create weapons. When he overheard the Soothsayer (his childhood nanny) foretell to his concerned parents that he would be defeated by a warrior of black and white if his obsession persisted, he led his wolves on a genocidal raid on the pandas in an attempt to circumvent the prophecy. But upon his return, his parents, horrified by what he has done, banished him from the city forever. Shen plotted his revenge for over twenty years, eventually creating an unstoppable weapon: a cannon. Although his weapon and army had temporarily brought him to power in Gongmen City, the Soothsayer's fortune did indeed come true when he was defeated by Po, the foretold warrior of black and white.","jobs":[{"href":"/subject/18580","name":"Kung Fu Panda 2","nameCn":"功夫熊猫 2","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/c5/91/18580_29QXX.jpg","staff":"主角","cast":"Gary Oldman","castHref":"/person/33504","castTag":"CV","castCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/a2/a8/33504_prsn_iNvtC.jpg"}]}
