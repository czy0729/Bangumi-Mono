She is played by Michal Sinnott. She has a very damaged relationship with the rest of her family; she is often seen arguing with her mother, regularly fighting with her brother, and is constantly bickering to her father, mostly over her efforts to seek fame by hanging out with porn producers and C-list celebrities, as well as her attempt to get on the reality program &quot;Fame or Shame.&quot; She is known to have sex with multiple people, and to also take various drugs, much to the disapproval of her father. Tracey is not seen socializing with her father much in the game; the only time they are seen communicating is when they are angry with each other. After the family returns to the house, Michael gets a call from Tracey, that someone is stalking her, so he helped her find the stalker and kills him, the two then bond afterwards as Michael teaches her the art of denial.<br />Sinnott intermittently worked on Grand Theft Auto V for three years.","jobs":[{"href":"/subject/56705","name":"Grand Theft Auto V","nameCn":"侠盗猎车手5","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/b4/79/56705_eFoam.jpg","staff":"配角","cast":"","castHref":"","castTag":"","castCover":""}]}
