Although her mother taught Avatar Korra's previous incarnation how to earthbend, Lin displayed no affection toward her when they first met. However, Lin's feelings toward the young Avatar changed when Amon and his Equalists made their public appearance and openly challenged the benders of the world. Lin is brave, loyal, and willing to sacrifice herself in order to do what she believes is right.","jobs":[{"href":"/subject/10599","name":"The Legend of Korra Book 1: Air","nameCn":"科拉传奇 第一季：气和","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/ed/16/10599_OOS7z.jpg","staff":"配角","cast":"","castHref":"","castTag":"","castCover":""},{"href":"/subject/43180","name":"The Legend of Korra Book 2: Spirits","nameCn":"科拉传奇 第二季：神灵","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/fa/ba/43180_j9TjZ.jpg","staff":"配角","cast":"","castHref":"","castTag":"","castCover":""}]}
