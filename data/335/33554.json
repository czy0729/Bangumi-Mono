She lives on Air Temple Island with her parents and three younger siblings: Ikki, Meelo, and Rohan. Besides being a master airbender, Jinora has an avid interest in books and is a quiet girl in general. She has a natural affinity with spirits and, prior to the reopening of the spirit portals, was one of only a handful of humans who could communicate with and perceive the spirits in the physical world. As a result, she became Avatar Korra's guide into the Spirit World. Sometime after 171 AG, she entered a romantic relationship with Kai.","jobs":[{"href":"/subject/114184","name":"The Legend of Korra Book 4: Balance","nameCn":"科拉传奇 第四季：平衡","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/53/9c/114184_b5U7U.jpg","staff":"配角","cast":"","castHref":"","castTag":"","castCover":"","type":2},{"href":"/subject/88411","name":"The Legend of Korra Book 3: Change","nameCn":"科拉传奇 第三季：易","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/56/89/88411_ZNs2x.jpg","staff":"配角","cast":"","castHref":"","castTag":"","castCover":"","type":2},{"href":"/subject/43180","name":"The Legend of Korra Book 2: Spirits","nameCn":"科拉传奇 第二季：神灵","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/fa/ba/43180_j9TjZ.jpg","staff":"配角","cast":"","castHref":"","castTag":"","castCover":"","type":2},{"href":"/subject/10599","name":"The Legend of Korra Book 1: Air","nameCn":"科拉传奇 第一季：气和","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/ed/16/10599_OOS7z.jpg","staff":"配角","cast":"","castHref":"","castTag":"","castCover":"","type":2}]}
