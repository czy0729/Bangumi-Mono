Humble Bundle continues to offer these limited-time bundles, but have expanded to include a greater and more persistent storefront. The Humble Bundle concept was initially run by Wolfire Games in 2010, but by its second bundle, the Humble Bundle company was spun out to manage the promotion, payments, and distribution of the bundles. In October 2017, the company was acquired by Ziff Davis through its IGN Entertainment subsidiary, though operates as a separate subsidiary.","works":[{"href":"/subject/321561","name":"Project Wingman / 僚机计划","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/53/46/321561_SP088.jpg","staff":"发行"},{"href":"/subject/321562","name":"Prodeus","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/4a/12/321562_RQHRB.jpg","staff":"发行"},{"href":"/subject/308689","name":"Carto","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/c4/a6/308689_91k8k.jpg","staff":"发行"},{"href":"/subject/313811","name":"Ring of Pain","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/68/f6/313811_MQjjm.jpg","staff":"发行"},{"href":"/subject/313220","name":"Popup Dungeon","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/31/78/313220_83RYM.jpg","staff":"发行"}]}
