Humble Bundle continues to offer these limited-time bundles, but have expanded to include a greater and more persistent storefront. The Humble Bundle concept was initially run by Wolfire Games in 2010, but by its second bundle, the Humble Bundle company was spun out to manage the promotion, payments, and distribution of the bundles. In October 2017, the company was acquired by Ziff Davis through its IGN Entertainment subsidiary, though operates as a separate subsidiary.","works":[{"href":"/subject/295288","name":"One Step From Eden / 伊甸之路","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/5f/bc/295288_hIa2H.jpg","staff":"发行"},{"href":"/subject/276605","name":"Temtem","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/0e/4e/276605_Ww5Q8.jpg","staff":"发行"},{"href":"/subject/291004","name":"Crying Suns / 哭泣的太阳","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/44/16/291004_2o1EP.jpg","staff":"发行"},{"href":"/subject/283546","name":"Void Bastards / 虚空混蛋","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/5b/48/283546_5oiTO.jpg","staff":"发行"},{"href":"/subject/283631","name":"Staxel / 方块物语","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/91/7f/283631_7m008.jpg","staff":"发行"}]}
