It was established in 2003 when Jakub Dvorský completed his thesis project at the Academy of Arts in Prague by creating a free online flash game called Samorost. In 2005, animator Václav Blín joined the studio and Samorost 2 was created. Since then, our team has expanded further to include several excellent collaborators - musicians Floex and Dva, programmers David Oliva, Peter Stehlík and Jan Werner, painter Adolf Lachman, sound effects expert Tomáš Dvořák and animator Jaromír Plachý. Besides making computer games, the studio has also created music videos, websites, animated works, and illustrations, and has done production design as well.","works":[{"href":"/subject/292306","name":"Pilgrims / 朝圣者","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/18/3d/292306_SoZs8.jpg","staff":"开发"},{"href":"/subject/239875","name":"CHUCHEL / 毛线先生","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/14/3a/239875_2j2C2.jpg","staff":"开发"},{"href":"/subject/38980","name":"Botanicula / 植物精灵","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/49/8b/38980_C7Pfq.jpg","staff":"开发"},{"href":"/subject/117947","name":"Machinarium Soundtrack / 机械迷城原声音乐","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/ac/a2/117947_f1tCE.jpg","staff":"厂牌"}]}
