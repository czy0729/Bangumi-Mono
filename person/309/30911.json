The company makes titles for the major platforms, including PC, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The company was founded by former members of Rebel Act Studios, who previously developed Severance: Blade of Darkness in 2001. Dave Cox is a producer at Konami who has helped out MercurySteam during the Castlevania: Lords of Shadow trilogy. In 2015, Nintendo Life reported that MercurySteam had worked on a Metroid prototype for Wii U and 3DS, that was later turned down and possibly retrofitted into a different project. It was later revealed that they had pitched for a remake of Metroid Fusion. This pitch was rejected, but because series creator Yoshio Sakamoto was impressed by the pitch and the team's love of Metroid, they were hired to collaborate on Metroid: Samus Returns instead.","works":[{"href":"/subject/217062","name":"メトロイド サムスリターンズ / 银河战士：萨姆斯归来","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/62/32/217062_473il.jpg","staff":"开发"},{"href":"/subject/41434","name":"Castlevania: Lords of Shadow – Mirror of Fate / 恶魔城：命运之镜","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/b9/4f/41434_0Zb4m.jpg","staff":"开发"},{"href":"/subject/10445","name":"Castlevania: Lords of Shadow / 恶魔城 暗影之王","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/35/c5/10445_ZG5NA.jpg","staff":"开发"},{"href":"/subject/82442","name":"Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 / 恶魔城：黑暗领主2","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/60/6f/82442_F78nn.jpg","staff":"开发"},{"href":"/subject/1797","name":"Clive Barker's Jericho / 克莱夫·巴克的耶利哥","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/8d/9f/1797_q2qSZ.jpg","staff":"开发"}]}
