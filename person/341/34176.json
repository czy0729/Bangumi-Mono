To sum it up we say we make games like we cook food: with a lot of love. We want to create that experience that you remember, that you have fantasies about long after the game is finished, that makes you feel alive and energized.<br /><br />Our studio is based in Montpellier in France – right above a bakery – but we work with a team of great collaborators around the world.<br /><br />In 2016, we released our adrenaline fuelled boss-fight only game FURI for PlayStation4, PC and Xbox One which is receiving raving reviews from players and press alike. The game is praised for its demanding mix of close combat and dual stick shoot, its unique art style and amazing electro soundtrack. We are still working hard on Furi while preparing our next dish…<br /><br />Our first game SQUIDS, an underwater tactical RPG on mobile from 2011 was a great success with an average 5 star user rating. SQUIDS Wild West, followed in its footsteps in 2012. SQUIDS Odyssey, the ultimate SQUIDS compilation is available for Wii U™ and Nintendo 3DS™ since 2014.<br /><br />Combo Crew our modern take on old-school brawlers was released in 2013, bringing fighting games to mobile with innovative touch controls. We added the heavyweights from Capcom’s Street Fighter 2 and Viewtiful Joe into the game. In 2014, we developed a TMNT brawler for mobile for Nickelodeon to launch with Michael Bay’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle movie.","works":[{"href":"/subject/275355","name":"Haven","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/6a/a4/275355_Q2fl9.jpg","staff":"开发"},{"href":"/subject/190760","name":"Furi / 弹幕武士","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/bb/eb/190760_1QYa0.jpg","staff":"发行"}]}
