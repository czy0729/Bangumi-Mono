He then started to work but could not give up his dream : being an animator. He started to learn animation by himself and is a completely self-educated artist. He now lives and works in Tokyo as a free-lance animator in adverising or music video for clients such as UNIQLO. Next to this, he creates his own animations based on metamorphosis and strange or impossible motions he sets up in an unlikely reality.","works":[{"href":"/subject/256660","name":"臨死!! 江古田ちゃん / 临死！！江古田","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/1e/a2/256660_6U3i6.jpg","staff":"OP・ED 分镜"},{"href":"/subject/213302","name":"透明な翼","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/f6/df/213302_jp.jpg","staff":"插图"},{"href":"/subject/185792","name":"リトルウィッチアカデミア / 小魔女学园","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/c5/09/185792_YmcaM.jpg","staff":"原画"},{"href":"/subject/180710","name":"こねこのチー ポンポンらー大冒険 / 甜甜私房猫 吃饱啦大冒险","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/75/8e/180710_ZnT5c.jpg","staff":"原画"}]}
