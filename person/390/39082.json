Our goal is to create games that fulfill that potential. We strive to create innovative and deeply moving experiences that will inspire players, challenge convention, and push the boundaries of interactive entertainment to new exciting areas.<br /><br />We are currently working on The Pathless, a mythic adventure game about an archer and an eagle in a vast forest. Our first project was ABZÛ, an epic descent into the depths of the sea.","works":[{"href":"/subject/268603","name":"The Pathless","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/71/ac/268603_K7xOO.jpg","staff":"开发"},{"href":"/subject/188850","name":"ABZÛ / 智慧之海","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/e5/4c/188850_QhoBF.jpg","staff":"开发"}]}
