Like many great violinists of his generation, he produced a characteristic sound which was immediately recognizable as his own. Although it derived in many respects from the Franco-Belgian school, his style is nonetheless reminiscent of the gemütlich (cozy) lifestyle of pre-war Vienna.","works":[{"href":"/subject/124771","name":"四月は君の嘘 トゥインクル リトルスター","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/0d/c5/124771_jFQO3.jpg","staff":"作曲"},{"href":"/subject/114868","name":"四月は君の嘘 僕と君との音楽帳 / 四月是你的谎言 我和你的音乐帐","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/ce/35/114868_jp.jpg","staff":"作曲"}]}
