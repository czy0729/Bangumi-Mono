She began to receive critical success for her writing in the 1860s. Early in her career, she sometimes used the pen name A. M. Barnard and under it wrote novels for young adults.<br /><br />Published in 1868, Little Women is set in the Alcott family home, Orchard House, in Concord, Massachusetts and is loosely based on Alcott's childhood experiences with her three sisters. The novel was very well received and is still a popular children's novel today. Alcott was an abolitionist and a feminist. She died in Boston on March 6, 1888.","works":[{"href":"/subject/53744","name":"若草物語ナンとジョー先生 / 小妇人物语 南与乔老师","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/8e/e3/53744_6wqEo.jpg","staff":"原作"},{"href":"/subject/68703","name":"愛の若草物語 / 爱的小妇人物语","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/c2/3e/68703_mFXVr.jpg","staff":"原作"},{"href":"/subject/73724","name":"若草の四姉妹 / 小妇人","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/98/95/73724_0UWp5.jpg","staff":"原作"}]}
