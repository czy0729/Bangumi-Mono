In May 2016, due to a declining toys-to-life games market overshadowed by the popularity of mobile gaming, Disney decided to step out of the video game industry, closing Disney Interactive Studios and all of its subsidiaries, including Avalanche Software. In January 2017, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment announced that they had acquired Avalanche Software and re-opened the company, which saw John Blackburn return as CEO.","works":[{"href":"/subject/61538","name":"Disney Infinity / 迪士尼无限","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/a0/ad/61538_O66TM.jpg","staff":"开发"},{"href":"/subject/315130","name":"Hogwarts Legacy","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/b7/77/315130_KSgj2.jpg","staff":"开发"}]}
