We expanded the Half-Life franchise with a sequel and Half-Life 2 Episodes 1 and 2. Then we added the horror titles Left 4 Dead® and Left 4 Dead 2, the multiplayer combat franchise Team Fortress®, the #1 online action game Counter-Strike® and the award-winning puzzlers Portal™ and Portal 2. And we’re just getting warmed up.<br /><br />Half-Life 2 | Counter-Strike: Source | Day of Defeat: Source | Half-Life 2: Episode 1 | Portal<br />Team Fortress 2 | Half-Life 2: Episode 2 | Left 4 Dead | Left 4 Dead 2 | Portal 2<br /><br />Social Entertainment Platform<br />Steam is our direct pipeline to customers. It began as a little sleeper project—a handy tool to update Counter-Strike—and morphed pretty quickly into the world's largest online gaming platform. Steam guarantees instant access to more than 1,800 game titles and connects its 35 million active users to each other—and to us. Through Steam, fans can easily buy, play, share, modify, and build communities around Valve products as well as titles from other independent game studios. Steam is available in 237 countries and 21 different languages.<br /><br />Technologies<br />In addition to Steam, there is Source, our own state-of-the-art game engine. Its sophisticated character animation, advanced AI, real-world physics, shader-based rendering, and super extensibility have helped us create some of the most popular and good-looking games on the market for computer and consoles. We don’t like to brag, but Source is considered the most flexible, comprehensive, and powerful game development environment out there. And it’s about to get even better.","works":[{"href":"/subject/306063","name":"Half-Life: Alyx Soundtrack","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/84/b9/306063_888h8.jpg","staff":"厂牌"},{"href":"/subject/295044","name":"Half-Life: Alyx / 半衰期：爱莉克斯","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/9e/1a/295044_8pw6Q.jpg","staff":"发行"},{"href":"/subject/54206","name":"Black Mesa / 黑山","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/a6/12/54206_G03VX.jpg","staff":"原作"},{"href":"/subject/285113","name":"Dota Underlords / 刀塔霸业","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/37/3c/285113_CR8Rd.jpg","staff":"发行"}]}
