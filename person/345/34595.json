He comes from a family of dancers including his grandmother, mother, aunt, and sister. It was at his sister's dance practices that he would stand outside the door and imitate the movements of the dancers inside. At age six, he was encouraged to step inside the door and, thus, his dance career began. His own story parallels that of Billy Elliot (2000) in that Jamie kept his dancing a secret from his friends at school. His mother had him when she was 16 and, unfortunately, he never knew his father.","voices":[{"href":"/character/25381","name":"Tintin","nameCn":"丁丁","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/s/29/8b/25381_crt_2IDxZ.jpg","subjectHref":"/subject/29647","subjectName":"The Adventures of Tintin","subjectNameCn":"丁丁历险记","staff":"主角","subjectCover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/f9/c1/29647_uX351.jpg"}],"works":[{"href":"/subject/196566","name":"TURN: Washington's Spies Season 3 / 逆转奇兵 第三季","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/7f/b7/196566_xaH8T.jpg","staff":"主演"},{"href":"/subject/218095","name":"TURN: Washington's Spies Season 4 / 逆转奇兵 第四季","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/f7/69/218095_a3h9U.jpg","staff":"主演"},{"href":"/subject/184208","name":"TURN: Washington's SpiesSeason 2 / 逆转奇兵 第二季","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/2d/4b/184208_c01Wb.jpg","staff":"主演"},{"href":"/subject/184207","name":"TURN: Washington's SpiesSeason 1 / 逆转奇兵 第一季","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/5a/34/184207_03j63.jpg","staff":"主演"}]}
