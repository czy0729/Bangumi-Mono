Before that time, Disney recordings were licensed out to a variety of other labels such as RCA, Decca, Capitol, and ABC-Paramount Records. It was Walt Disney’s brother Roy O. Disney who suggested that Walt Disney Productions (now the modern-day Walt Disney Company) form their own record label. Roy enlisted longtime staffer Jimmy Johnson to head this new division. It adopted its current name in 1989. The label currently releases soundtracks from Disney's motion pictures and theme parks, as well as, traditional studio albums produced by its roster of pop, teen pop, and country artists.","works":[{"href":"/subject/277952","name":"CONNECTED TO DISNEY","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/73/c2/277952_rD74W.jpg","staff":"厂牌"},{"href":"/subject/199311","name":"Moana","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/58/54/199311_us.jpg","staff":"录音"},{"href":"/subject/174652","name":"Zootopia (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/39/a2/174652_us.jpg","staff":"厂牌"},{"href":"/subject/100895","name":"ディズニー声のドリーム・デュエット","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/20/d1/100895_jp.jpg","staff":"录音"}]}
