The studio was acquired by Take-Two Interactive in 2006. The studio was known for its games System Shock 2, Freedom Force, SWAT 4, and most notably two of the games in the BioShock series. Following the release of BioShock Infinite in 2014, Levine opted to significantly restructure the studio from around 90 to 15 employees and focus more on narrative games. In February 2017, the studio announced that it had been rebranded as Ghost Story Games and considered a fresh start from the original Irrational name, though still operating at the same business subsidiary under Take-Two.","works":[{"href":"/subject/8703","name":"Bioshock Infinite / 生化奇兵：无限","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/21/2a/8703_2B60M.jpg","staff":"开发"},{"href":"/subject/638","name":"BioShock / 生化奇兵","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/4c/27/638_4Z3N0.jpg","staff":"开发"},{"href":"/subject/242782","name":"SWAT 4: The Stetchkov Syndicate / 霹雳小组4：斯氏集团","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/c0/49/242782_Ws7X7.jpg","staff":"开发"},{"href":"/subject/241860","name":"SWAT 4 / 霹雳小组4","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/ba/a1/242213_zkskb.jpg","staff":"开发"},{"href":"/subject/88606","name":"Freedom Force / 自由力量","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/4e/77/88606_HDSDg.jpg","staff":"开发"}]}
