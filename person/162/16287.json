The O is for “och”, which is the Swedish word for “and”. We have been making games, or at least game-like things, as Simogo since 2010. Our tiny office is located in the very south of Sweden in Malmö, not far from the train station.We don’t have 100% defined roles, but Gordon is mostly responsible for code, papers and numbers, and Simon for art, sounds and words.","works":[{"href":"/subject/268585","name":"Sayonara Wild Hearts","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/d9/ef/268585_JYH28.jpg","staff":"开发"},{"href":"/subject/169451","name":"SPL-T","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/4f/1d/169451_I78e1.jpg","staff":"发行"},{"href":"/subject/121320","name":"The Sensational December Machine / 绝妙的十二月机器","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/78/e0/121320_4a7xv.jpg","staff":"开发"},{"href":"/subject/117260","name":"The Sailor’s Dream / 水手之梦","cover":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/cover/g/b2/35/117260_HDkRl.jpg","staff":"开发"}]}
